Public Transport Reliability and Incident Analytics API

# Transport Reliability & Incident Analytics API

This project is a RESTful API that analyses public transport reliability by combining
route and station data with user-reported delay incidents. The API provides CRUD
operations and analytical endpoints for reliability metrics and delay patterns.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI (Python)
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic
- pytest

## Features
- CRUD operations for routes, stations, and user-reported incidents
- Analytics endpoints for route reliability and delay distributions
- JWT-based authentication (planned)
- OpenAPI / Swagger documentation

## Running the Project (Coming Soon)
Instructions for setting up and running the API locally will be added here.

## API Documentation
The API documentation will be available as a PDF in: docs/api-documentation.pdf

## Deployment
The live deployment URL will be added here once the API is deployed.

## Version Control
This project uses GitHub for version control with incremental commits to demonstrate
development progress.
